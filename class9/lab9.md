> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and

HIV search came up with 4886 structures.

## Visualising structure data

The Mol\* Viewer is embeded in many bioinfo websites. Homepage is
https://molstar.org/

We can insert any figure/image file using markdown This is HIV Protease

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom
> per water molecule in this structure?

It would look too crowded to have each individual atom in the water
molecule on this structure

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding
> site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does
> this water molecule have

Water 308, highlighted above as a red circle in the image below near the
highlighted amino acids.

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains
> of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing
> the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we
> recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to
> your Quarto document. Discussion Topic: Can you think of a way in
> which indinavir, or even larger ligands and substrates, could enter
> the binding site?

## Bio3D package for structural informatics

We can use the bio3d package to read and analuse biomolecular data in R:

``` r
library(bio3d)

#read in pdb file
hiv<-read.pdb("1hsg")
```

      Note: Accessing on-line PDB file

``` r
#preview atom
head(hiv$atom)
```

\##Prediction of Functional Motions

We can run Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) to predict large scale
motions/flexibility/dynamics of any biomolecule that we can read into R.

Lets look into ADK

``` r
adk<-read.pdb("1ake")
```

      Note: Accessing on-line PDB file
       PDB has ALT records, taking A only, rm.alt=TRUE

``` r

## Play with 3D viewing in R

We can use the new **bio3dview** package, which is not yet on CRAN, to
render interactive 3D views in R and HTML quarto output reports. Need to

There are 214 amino acids in this sequence

Commented out as document won’t render.

``` r
# Blast or hmmer search 
#b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

also commented out as above is not working

``` r
# Plot a summary of search results
#hits <- plot(b)
# List out some 'top hits'
#head(hits$pdb.id)
```

putting these into a vector

``` r
hits <- c()
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

This chunk works, however will not render unless I comment out.

all the structures are jumbled up - need to align them

``` r
pdbs<- pdbaln(files, fit=TRUE, exefile="msa")

output of this is quite big, lets use PCA to visualise it

``` r
pc.xray<-pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray,1:2)
```

![](lab9_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)

``` r
mktrj(pc.xray, file="pca_results.pdb")
```

``` r
#library(pak)
#view.pca(pc.xray)
```
