This is the nano text editor - as simple as it comes.

git: 	version control
pwd: 	print working directory (where the hell am I)
cd: 	change directory
ls: 	listing files and directories
mkdir:make a director
rm:	  remove files (i.e. delete)
nano: text editor
cp:   copy a file (cp source result)
mv:   rename or move a file (mv source result)
less: to see the contents of a text file
grep: pattern match
man : manual (eg. man pwd gives you help page for pwd)
&:    add to the end of a command to run job in the background

process control
^C    control-C to kill a running job
^Z    put to sleep a running job
top:  display the top running processes
kill PID  kill a job with this pid number
ps:   list all active jobs

Absolute path: where stuff is spelled out from the root of the file systems, e.g. 
/Users/mehathakur/Desktop/class15

Relative path: where stuff is relative to where you are currently (i.e. your current working directory)

Useful shortcuts: "~" and ".."

syntax: cd ~/Downloads/ -- note spaces and slashes

Instance ID

i-007817323445c38c6 (bggn213_meha)
- Open an SSH client.
- Locate your private key file. The key used to launch this instance is meha.pem
- Run this command, if necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable.
chmod 400 "meha.pem"
- Connect to your instance using its Public DNS:
ec2-35-86-107-61.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Example:

ssh -i "meha.pem" ubuntu@ec2-35-86-107-61.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com -- this connects to the cloud?


*     wild card match everything (matches everything). allows automating of batch processing

gunzip *.gz --> unzips everything in the folder
head -11 mouse.1.protein.faa > mm-first.fa --> put first 11 lines in this file

if i want to know how many proteins are in this file - 

grep ">" mm-first --> look for ">" in the specified file mm-first. This just prints out each line with > (which will be all the proteins here)

-c --> how many

grep -c ">" *.faa --> apply grep to all in dataset

makeblastdb -in zebrafish.1.protein.faa -dbtype prot

gonna run blastp

head -497 mouse.1.protein.faa > mm-second.fa
grep -c ">" *.fa

^Z stops the thing
scp allows us to "secure copy" files from the virtual machine into our own computer (for use in R or whatever)
scp -i "~/Downloads/meha.pem" ubuntu@ec2-35-86-107-61.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/work/mm-second.x.zebrafish.tsv .
scp -i KEYFILE USERNAME@REMOTE_MACHINE:remoteFILE LOCALFILE
space then dot at the end copies into current directory. open this in a new terminal that is not logged into the machine
