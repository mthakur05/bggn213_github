student2 <- c(100, NA, 90, 90, 90, 90, 97, 80)

```{r}

grade<- function(data){
  
  
  data[is.na(vector)]<-0. #replace NA values to 0
  lowest<- min(data$)  #recognise the lowest value in the vector (lowest score)
  score<-sum(vector)-lowest #add all grades and drop the lowest

  return(score) #return the calculated score
}

```


##Question 2
Using your grade() function and the supplied gradebook, Who is the top scoring student overall in the gradebook? [3pts]
```{r}
